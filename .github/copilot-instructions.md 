We use npm for managing our javascript dependencies, not yarn or pnpm, so when talking about Javascript packages, always give me instructions and code samples that use npm.

We always use regular for loops instead of forEach.

We avoid reduce for readability.

We respect eslint rules provided in .eslintrc.js.


We write test files use chai and mocha. 

We use mock-fs for mocking in test files. mock-fs is imported as `import mockFs from mock-fs`. 

For readability, mockFs uses JSON.stringify with json objects. 

globby should not be stubbed. 

When methods are only exported for tests, we wrap them in an object called "forTesting"
