# Permissions and Secrets

## Overview

GitHub Actions workflows have access to `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatic) and repository secrets (configured). Overly broad permissions amplify the impact of any vulnerability. Proper permission scoping is the single most effective mitigation for GitHub Actions attacks.

## GITHUB_TOKEN Permissions

### Default Permissions

GitHub offers two default permission modes (configured in repo Settings > Actions > General):

| Mode                                | Default Permissions                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Read and write** (legacy default) | `contents: write`, `packages: write`, etc. |
| **Read-only** (recommended)         | `contents: read` only                      |

### Explicit Permission Scoping

```yaml
# VULNERABLE: No explicit permissions — inherits repo default
on: pull_request
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "What permissions does GITHUB_TOKEN have?"

# SAFE: Explicit minimal permissions at workflow level
on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "GITHUB_TOKEN can only read"
```

### Permission Scopes

| Permission        | Read               | Write                         | Use Cases                |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `contents`        | Clone, read files  | Push commits, create releases | Most workflows need read |
| `pull-requests`   | View PRs           | Comment, approve, merge       | PR review bots           |
| `issues`          | View issues        | Create, comment, close        | Issue management         |
| `packages`        | Pull packages      | Push packages                 | Package publishing       |
| `deployments`     | View deployments   | Create deployments            | CD workflows             |
| `id-token`        | —                  | Request OIDC token            | Cloud authentication     |
| `actions`         | View workflow runs | Cancel/rerun workflows        | Workflow management      |
| `security-events` | View alerts        | Upload SARIF, dismiss alerts  | Security scanning        |
| `statuses`        | View statuses      | Create commit statuses        | CI status reporting      |

### Dangerous Permission Patterns

```yaml
# DANGEROUS: write-all grants everything
permissions: write-all

# DANGEROUS: Broad permissions on untrusted trigger
on: pull_request_target
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  packages: write

# SUSPICIOUS: id-token on workflows that don't deploy
on: pull_request
permissions:
  id-token: write  # Why does a PR build need OIDC?
```

## Secret Management

### Secret Exposure Vectors

#### Via Expression Injection

```yaml
# VULNERABLE: Secret value ends up in shell where injection can capture it
env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
steps:
  - run: echo "Processing ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
    # Expression injection here can access $API_KEY from environment
```

#### Via Workflow Logs

```yaml
# VULNERABLE: Derived values from secrets may not be masked
- run: |
    ENCODED=$(echo "${{ secrets.API_KEY }}" | base64)
    echo "Encoded key: $ENCODED"  # GitHub only masks the original secret value
```

GitHub Actions automatically masks secret values in logs, but **derived values** (base64-encoded, truncated, transformed) are NOT masked.

#### Via Artifacts

```yaml
# VULNERABLE: Secrets written to files that become artifacts
- run: |
    echo "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}" > deploy_key.pem
    # If this file ends up in an artifact, the secret is exposed
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-output
    path: . # Includes deploy_key.pem!
```

#### Via Pull Request Target

```yaml
# VULNERABLE: Fork code can access org secrets
on: pull_request_target
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
      - run: ./build.sh # Fork code can read all secrets via ${{ secrets.* }}
```

**Important:** Secrets are available to `pull_request_target` workflows. Combined with fork checkout, this exposes every secret to attacker code.

## Detection Patterns

```bash
# Find workflows without explicit permissions
grep -L "permissions:" .github/workflows/*.yml

# Find workflows with write-all
grep -rn "write-all" .github/workflows/

# Find workflows with broad write permissions
grep -rn "write$" .github/workflows/ | grep -v "#"

# Find secret usage
grep -rn "secrets\." .github/workflows/

# Find secrets in pull_request_target workflows
for f in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
  if grep -q "pull_request_target" "$f" && grep -q "secrets\." "$f"; then
    echo "ALERT: $f uses secrets with pull_request_target"
  fi
done

# Find workflows that write secrets to files
grep -A2 "secrets\." .github/workflows/*.yml | grep -E ">\s|>>|tee "

# Check for environment-level secrets
grep -rn "environment:" .github/workflows/
```

## OIDC Subject Claim Misconfiguration

GitHub OIDC tokens include a `sub` (subject) claim that cloud providers use to authorize access. Misconfigured subject claims can allow unauthorized workflows to assume cloud roles.

```yaml
# VULNERABLE: Subject claim too broad — any branch can assume role
# AWS IAM trust policy
{
  "Condition": {
    "StringLike": {
      "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:org/repo:*"  # Any ref!
    }
  }
}

# SAFE: Restrict to specific branch and environment
{
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:org/repo:environment:production"
    }
  }
}
```

### OIDC Best Practices

| Claim Filter                           | Risk Level | When to Use                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `repo:org/repo:*`                      | **High**   | Never — any branch/PR can assume role |
| `repo:org/repo:ref:refs/heads/main`    | **Medium** | Only main branch, but any workflow    |
| `repo:org/repo:environment:production` | **Low**    | Requires environment protection rules |

## The Fix: Minimal Permissions Pattern

### Workflow-Level Defaults

```yaml
# Set restrictive defaults at workflow level
permissions:
  contents: read

# Override per-job only when needed
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Inherits workflow permissions: contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm run lint

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write # Only this job needs OIDC
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
```

### Secret Scoping with Environments

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production # Secrets only available in this environment
    steps:
      - run: deploy --key ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
```

Environment protection rules add:

- Required reviewers
- Wait timers
- Branch restrictions
- Deployment protection rules

## Severity Guidelines

| Pattern                                             | Severity     | Rationale                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `write-all` on `pull_request_target`                | **Critical** | Maximum permissions + fork code execution           |
| No `permissions:` block (inherits repo default)     | **Medium**   | May have write access depending on repo settings    |
| `contents: write` on PR-triggered workflow          | **High**     | Allows pushing commits if combined with other vulns |
| Secrets in `pull_request_target` with fork checkout | **Critical** | All secrets exposed to attacker code                |
| OIDC with wildcard subject claim                    | **High**     | Any workflow can assume cloud role                  |
| Secrets written to files/artifacts                  | **High**     | Persistent exposure beyond workflow run             |
