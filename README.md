**Lion is a set of highly performant, accessible and flexible Web Components.!**

They provide an unopinionated, white-label layer that can be extended to your own layer of components.

- **High Performance:** Focused on great performance in all relevant browsers with a minimal number of dependencies.
- **Accessibility:** Aimed at compliance with the WCAG 2.2 AA standard to create components that are accessible for everybody.
- **Flexibility:** Provides solutions through Web Components and JavaScript classes which can be used, adopted and extended to fit all needs.
- **Modern Code:** Lion is distributes as pure es modules.
- **Exposes functions/classes and Web Components:** Ships a functionality in it's most appropriate form.

> Note: Our demos may look a little bland but that is on purpose. They only come with functional stylings.
> This makes sense as the main use case is to extend those components and if you do you do not want to override existing stylings.

## Astro migration

- Keep using `/docs` on the root level as we used it in the `master` branch. The documentation is copied into Astro related directories on `npm run start` and when when anything in `/docs` is updated.
- Replace manually all references to assets in all `md` files so that we imply that the path is produced from the directory where the md file is located. F.e. `new URL('../src/wa-combobox/assets/obama.jpeg', import.meta.url).href;` should `new URL('./src/wa-combobox/assets/obama.jpeg', import.meta.url).href;`. Note double dot is replaced with one dot. See [this PR](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/pull/2125/files#diff-403b1e0ab54d51dcfe54248e847498e492da00383d8b33a4087994ab9035a22c) for the reference.
- Rename all `*.mjs` files to `*.js` ones if they are used by `mdjs` examples

### Astro how to

- To start in dev mode run `nmm run start`
- To start in production mode:
  - Run `npm run build`
  - Run `npm run preview`

### Issues which are not caused by the migration (not to be fixed now)

- There is a browser console error on [collapsible page](http://localhost:4321/components/collapsible):

  ```
  __mdjs-stories--use-cases.js:40 Uncaught TypeError: shadowRoot.getElementById is not a function
  ```

  Note. There is the same error on master. This issue is not caused by the migration

### TODO

## How to install

```bash
npm i @lion/ui
```

## How to use

### Extend a Web Component

**This is the main use case for lion**. To import component classes, and extend them for your own design system's components.

```js
import { css } from 'lit';
import { LionInput } from '@lion/ui/input.js';

class MyInput extends LionInput {
  static get styles() {
    return [
      super.styles,
      css`
        /* your styles here */
      `,
    ];
  }
}
customElements.define('my-input', MyInput);
```

### Use a JavaScript system

There's a couple of "systems" in lion which have a JavaScript API. Examples are `localize`, `overlays`, `ajax`, etc.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { ajax } from '@lion/ui/ajax.js';

  ajax
    .fetch('data.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      // do something with the data
    });
</script>
```

### Use a Web Component

You can also use the lion elements directly, although this is likely not a common use case.

```html
<script type="module">
  import '@lion/ui/define/lion-input.js';
</script>

<lion-input name="firstName"></lion-input>
```

## Technologies

Lion Web Components aims to be future-proof and use well-supported proven technology. The stack we have chosen should reflect this.

- [lit](https://lit.dev/)
- [npm](http://npmjs.com)
- [Open Web Components](https://open-wc.org)
- [Modern Web](https://modern-web.dev)
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org)
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- [prettier](https://prettier.io)
- [ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
- Lots and lots of tests

## Rationale

We know from experience that making high quality, accessible UI components is hard and time consuming:
it takes many iterations, a lot of development time and a lot of testing to get a generic component that works in every
context, supports many edge cases and is accessible in all relevant screen readers.

Lion aims to do the heavy lifting for you.
This means you only have to apply your own Design System: by delivering styles, configuring components and adding a minimal set of custom logic on top.

## Coding guidelines

Check out our [coding guidelines](https://lion-web.netlify.app/guides/principles/definitions-and-terms/) for more detailed information.

## How to contribute

**Please note:** This project uses Npm [Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces). If you want to run all demos locally you need to get at least npm 7+ and install all dependencies by executing `npm install`.

Lion Web Components are only as good as its contributions.
Read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and feel free to enhance/improve Lion. We keep feature requests closed while we're not working on them.
