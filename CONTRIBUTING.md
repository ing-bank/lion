# Contributing

Check out ways to contribute to Lion Web Components:

## Feature requests

When you have an idea on how we could improve, please check our [discussions](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/discussions) to see if there are similar ideas or feature requests. If there are none, please [start](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/discussions/new) your feature request as a new discussion topic. Add the title `[Feature Request] My awesome feature` and a description of what you expect from the improvement and what the use case is.
