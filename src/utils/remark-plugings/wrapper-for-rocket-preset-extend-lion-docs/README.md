# Dev notes

- It is not possible to use `rocket-preset-extend-lion-docs` out of the box. The reason is that its code relies on some Rocket specific global JS variable names (f.e. `plugins` variable in node_modules/plugins-manager/src/addPlugin.js). Also it specifies the order among existing plugins to inject the its internal plugins (see more for details https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages-node/rocket-preset-extend-lion-docs/preset/extendLionDocs.js#L66). We can't reuse that order. Same applies to the dependent `remarkUrlToLocal` plugin. To integrate `rocket-preset-extend-lion-docs` the following steps were done:
  - `src/utils/remark-plugings/wrapper-for-rocket-preset-extend-lion-docs/assets` contains the patched files taken from the original plugins. Then during the installation those files are copied to `node_modules`. The script for copying is defined in `src/utils/remark-plugings/wrapper-for-rocket-preset-extend-lion-docs/copy.sh` and it is currently triggered by `postinstall` command in `package.json`
  - `src/utils/remark-plugings/wrapper-for-rocket-preset-extend-lion-docs/wrapper.js` contains a copy of `P00019-ing-web/rocket.config.mjs`. That is configuration setup where we specify the replacement rules. F.e here we specify that `<lion-` should be changed to `<ing-button`.
