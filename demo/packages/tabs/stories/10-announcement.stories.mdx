# ING Bank open sources lion

> Bring the web forward - one component at a time.

As many of you may already know, ING has a long and rich history of Web Components, starting out with the Polymer library, all the way up to the recently released LitElement.

[Need a refresher?](https://medium.com/ing-blog/ing-%EF%B8%8F-web-components-f52aacc71d7a) Web Components are a set of browser standards that allow us to write browser native, reusable, encapsulated, and modular components. More specifically, the standards that allow us to do so are: [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements), [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import), [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM), [HTML Templates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template).

For a long time, Polymer was _the_ synonym for Web Components, but today thats no longer the case. The Web Components standards have matured, and a lot has happened since the V0 specification. Today, there are many ways to build and consume your Web Components, like: [Angular Elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Skate](https://github.com/skatejs/skatejs), [Hybrids](https://github.com/hybridsjs/hybrids), [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction/) and many, many more. And with the release of the new [Chromium Edge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066767/microsoft-edge-chromium-new-browser-windows-mac-download-os), this means that all major browsers support Web Components natively.

So today, I'm happy to share with you all that ING is open-sourcing it's own core library of Web Components: lion! 🎉

## Why Lion?

Imagine the following fictional scenario:

> Alfred works at getRich.com, and is working on a new in-house application.

### Agnostic

Finding components is hard, and can lead to a lot of frustration.

> Alfred finds a perfect component for his use case, but unfortunately, it's written in a specific JavaScript framework, and GetRich.com uses a different framework, so he's not able to use it.

Additionally, companies have their own visual identities, and overriding fully styled components to make them look like the companies identity, can sometimes be more work than starting styling from scratch.

> Alfred finds a component that offers all the needed functionalities, however looks vastly different from GetRich.com's identity.

### Customize Functionality

Once you've found your perfect component, at some point down the line you may discover that the component lacks some kind of functionality that you would like to achieve.

> Alfred decides to copy over the code, and implement the feature himself, and as a result now has to maintain the entire component as well, which becomes an added burden to the project.

### Accessibility

Your components should be usable by every kind of user. Accessibility is hard to get right, but an essential feature, additionally, accessibility issues can be impossible to fix at a later stage without breaking changes, so its crucial to incorporate accessibility right from the start.

> Somewhere down the line, Alfred finds an accessibility issue with a component he found online. He can't fix this issue in his code, so he asks the maintainers to fix the accessibility issue, who tell him it's not possible to fix it without doing a breaking change.

Or, alternatively

> Alfred writes his own component, and the accessibility issue is hard to fix because of the way he initially wrote his HTML structure, and will also lead to a breaking change.

### Summary

Does Alfred's story feel relatable?

It highlights multiple common issues in modern web development:
- Finding and adding a dependency is a big deal
- Picking something because of looks along might not always be the best choice
- Adjusting custom behavior/stylings can be tough to maintain
- If a package is popular it doesn't mean it has good accessibility/performance
- UI components are hard to get _right_

### What can we do to tackle these issues?

🤔 Imagine having components that purely focus on functionality, and leave the design up to you
🤔 Imagine that these components come with great accessibility and performance
🤔 Imagine these components offer great extendability and flexibility

Now stop imagining, and look at lion 🦁

## What is lion?

> We want to bring the web forward - one component at a time.

Lion is a white label, open source, framework agnostic component library, and can  be the foundation for your codified in-house Design System. Aligning on design and usability is already a tough challenge, with Lion, we hope to take some of the work out of your hands.

### White Label
Lion is a core package of white label Web Components. What this means is that the core components only consist of very minimal styling, yet has all the fundamental functionalities. White label products are often created so others can easily rebrand them with their own visual identity. This is great, because it means that everyone can use the core functionalities of our components, while bringing their own branding or design system, because surprisingly, not everyone loves orange.

Check out the [Lion demo's](http://lion-web-components.netlify.com/). Looks plain, doesn't it?

And this is exactly what we at ING do as well. Our ing-web components extend the lion components, and apply our own ING visual identity which mostly is a thin layer on top of lion.

Let's take a look at how Lion and ing-web compare to eachother:

<<---- ADD IMAGE ----->>

### 🎯 Focus
Lion was designed with a focus on global UX and reusability in mind. And as such, the following features were incorporated right from the start:

♻️ Reusability - Our components are meant to be distributed and used on a global scale
🚹 Accessibility - Our components are meant to be accessible for everyone
🚀 Performance - Our components are meant to be small, performant and fast

These features allows us to roll out our components globally and have a single point of truth, and ensure that everyone in ING has a solid set of building blocks to build their application with, and get up and running in no time.

### Lessons learned

ING started using web components very early on, and Lion is not the first component library we built. So you may wonder, how are these components different from the previous generation?

Lion is built from the ground up allow for accessibility and extendability as we learned that these things are almost impossible to change/achieve at a later point. We'd like to highlight a few of the lessons learned while making the new set of components.

- Not everything has to be a Web Component, for certain functionality regular JavaScript is better.
- Stay as close to native semantic HTML elements as possible.
- Incorporate accessibility from the start.
- Not everything needs to be in the shadow DOM, this is especially important for aria relations and accessibility.
- UI components are hard

## 🙋‍ Looking For Contributors/Adopters!

In order for the open sourcing of Lion to be a success, we need your helping hand! What can you do?

### Adopt Lion!

Mainly you can help by starting using Lion! 👍

The more extending components and users there are, the more stable the Lion base will become, which helps everyone who uses Lion.

Consider:
- Promoting Lion within your company
- Showing Lion to your Tech Architects
- Bring Lion up if there is a plan to start (codifying) your Design System

- Extending Lion to make a web component version of your favorite design systems, such as: [Bulma](https://bulma.io/expo/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Material](https://material.io/design/), [Bolt](https://boltdesignsystem.com/), [Argon](https://demos.creative-tim.com/vue-argon-design-system/documentation/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Or even suggest Lion to them!

### Contribute to Lion!

If you want to do more you can help Lion directly by:

- Reporting/fixing issues
- Working on a completely new component (start with an issue for discussion first)
- Improving documentation
- ... every contribution counts! Even typo fixes in the docs 🤓


## 🔨 Extend the components

You can use Lion as the base to implement your own codified design system.

Let see how Alfred's story would have panned out if he would have chosen Lion instead.

First install what you need

```bash
npm i lit-element @lion/tabs
```

Create `alfred-tabs` by reusing the functionality of Lion. This gives Alfred all the functionality and accessible core that he needs for his custom tabs component.

```js
import { css } from 'lit-element';
import { LionTabs } from '@lion/tabs';

export class AlfredTabs extends LionTabs {
  static get styles() {
    return [
      super.styles,
      css`
        /* my stylings */
      `
    ];
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback();
    this._setupFeature();
  }

  _setupFeature() {
    // being awesome
  }
}
```

Alfred also wants to be able to style the tab and tab-panel according to GetRich.com's visual identity. In order to do so, he creates a `alfred-tab-panel` and a `alfred-tab` component, which he can then fully style however he desires, and eventually place inside the `alfred-tabs` component. You can see how Alfred achieved this in the example down below.

```js
import { LitElement, html, css } from 'lit-element';

export class AlbertTab extends LitElement {
  static get styles() {
    return css`/* my stylings */`;
  }

  render() {
    return html`
      <!-- dom as needed -->
      <slot></slot>
    `;
  }
}
```

Excellent! Alfred can now use the tabs component like so:

```html
<alfred-tabs>
  <alfred-tab slot="tab">Info</alfred-tab>
  <alfred-tab-panel slot="panel">
    Info page with lots of information about us.
  </alfred-tab-panel>
  <alfred-tab slot="tab">Work</alfred-tab>
  <alfred-tab-panel slot="panel">
    Work page that showcases our work.
  </alfred-tab-panel>
</alfred-tabs>
```

There we go, Alfred's component is already done, so let's write some documentation.

See the [live alfred tabs documentation page](?path=/docs/intro-tabs-example--default-story).

P.S.: Do note that Alfred is now responsible for keeping the documentation of `alfred-tabs` up to date himself, and improvements on Lion documentation will not automatically be reflected on Alfred's documentation.

### Why Open Source?
Component libraries are in huge demand. By open sourcing our extendable components, we help people to do your thing, while reaping all the benefits from the open source community. What's more is that any contribution made to lion directly impacts and benefits every design system using it (and ing-web) on a global scale. This means we get the best of both worlds by helping people with our components, and getting valuable contributions from the community!

If there are issues or missing core features [please let us know](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/issues).

### Stay tuned

Lion comprises of multiple Systems like Forms, Overlays, Localization, ... each solves a different challenge in a unique way.
We will highlight them in future blog posts.
