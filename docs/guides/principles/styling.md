# Principles >> Styling ||30

## Markup and styling

All Lion web components have white label styling: this means theming is not applied,
but functional styling is.

### Functional styling

Functional styling can be divided into defaults for `basic layout` and `accessibility`.
Examples for both categories can be found below:

- Basic layout examples:

  - A dropdown menu has `position: absolute;`.
  - A lion-button might behave as an `display: inline-block;` element.
  - A suffix attached to an input is horizontally positioned (instead of vertically stacked).

- Accessibility examples:
  - Content (for instance a caption in a table) can be `visually hidden`: it will be
    readable by screen readers, but invisible for end users.
  - When an html table is used, we allow [subclassers](./subclasser-apis.md) to override the display property (`table-cell`) to `flex`. By putting the proper accessible roles (`role="cell"`) in the markup, we guarantee our markup stays accessible.

Although Lion components try to stay as unbiased as possible with regard to styling, defaults will be needed. In these cases we try to follow the platform as much as possible. If the platform doesn't provide defaults, the largest common denominator across existing UI systems is taken as a lead.

## CSS variables

Css variables will not be added in our white label style components, but adding them in your own extension layer would be a perfect fit.

## Parts and themes

The `::part` and `::theme` specs might currently not be widely adopted enough to be used inside style components. When they are, we could be consider to add them later to our components as a means to theme components (changing a whole Design System is not a good idea).
