# Node Tools >> Providence Analytics >> QueryResult ||50

When an Analyzer has run, it returns a QueryResult. This is a json object that contains all
meta info (mainly configuration parameters) and the query output.
A QueryResult always contains the analysis of one project (a target project). Optionally,
it can contain a reference project as well.

## Anatomy

A QueryResult starts with a meta section, followed by the actual results

### Meta

The meta section lists all configuration options the analyzer was run with. Here, you see an
example of a `find-imports` QueryResult:

```js
  "meta": {
    "searchType": "ast-analyzer",
    "analyzerMeta": {
      "name": "find-imports",
      "requiredAst": "babel",
      "identifier": "importing-target-project_0.0.2-target-mock__1970011674",
      "targetProject": {
        "name": "importing-target-project",
        "commitHash": "3e5014d6ecdff1fc71138cdb29aaf7bf367588f5",
        "version": "0.0.2-target-mock"
      },
      "configuration": {
        "keepInternalSources": false
      }
    }
  },
```

### Output

The output is usually more specifically tied to the Analyzer. What most regular Analyzers
(not being MatchAnalyzers that require a referenceProjectPath) have in common, is that their
results are being shown per "entry" (an entry corresponds with an AST generated by Babel, which in
turn corresponds to a file found in a target or reference project).

Below an example is shown of `find-imports` QueryOutput:

```js
  "queryOutput": [
    {
      "project": {
        "name": "importing-target-project",
        "mainEntry": "./target-src/match-imports/root-level-imports.js",
        "version": "0.0.2-target-mock",
        "commitHash": "3e5014d6ecdff1fc71138cdb29aaf7bf367588f5"
      },
      "entries": [
        {
          "file": "./target-src/find-imports/all-notations.js",
          "result": [
            {
              "importSpecifiers": [
                "[file]"
              ],
              "source": "imported/source",
              "normalizedSource": "imported/source",
              "fullSource": "imported/source"
            },
            {
              "importSpecifiers": [
                "[default]"
              ],
              "source": "imported/source-a",
              "normalizedSource": "imported/source-a",
              "fullSource": "imported/source-a"
            },
            ...
```

MatchAnalyzers usually do post processing on the entries. The output below (for the `match-imports`
Analyzer) shows an ordering by matched specifier.

```js
 "queryOutput": [
    {
      "exportSpecifier": {
        "name": "[default]",
        "project": "exporting-ref-project",
        "filePath": "./index.js",
        "id": "[default]::./index.js::exporting-ref-project"
      },
      "matchesPerProject": [
        {
          "project": "importing-target-project",
          "files": [
            "./target-src/match-imports/root-level-imports.js",
            "./target-src/match-subclasses/internalProxy.js"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
```

Due to some legacy decisions, the QueryOutput allows for multiple target- and reference projects.
Aggregation of data now takes place in the dashboard.
QueryOutputs always contain one or a combination of two projects. This means that the
QueryOutput structure could be simplified in the future.

## Environment agnosticism

The output files stored in the file system always need to be machine independent:
this means that all machine specific information, like a complete filepath, needs to be removed from a QueryOutput (paths relative from project root are still allowed).
In that way, the caching mechanism (based on hash comparisons) as described in [Analyzer](../../../docs/node-tools/providence-analytics/analyzer.md) is guaranteed to work across different machines.
