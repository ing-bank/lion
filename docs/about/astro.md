# Astro Portal Announcement

We are excited to introduce the new version of our portal, now built with the Astro framework! You can access it at <a href="/next" rel="noopener noreferrer">/next</a>.

## What’s New?

- **Modern Look & Feel:** The UI will be redesigned in close collaboration with our designers. Expect further improvements as the design team continues to enhance the user experience.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find components and documentation with the new search feature.
- **Upgraded Dependencies:** All major dependencies and approaches have been updated for better performance, security, and maintainability.

## Compatibility

The new Astro portal is fully compatible with the previous Rocket-based portal. Maintaining the same structure and functionality was a key challenge and priority, ensuring a seamless experience for all users. Both portals will run in parallel in the near term future. During the course of 2026 the Astro portal will become the default.

## For Developers

The technical release of the Astro portal is primarily aimed at developers. We encourage you to explore the new features and provide feedback.
