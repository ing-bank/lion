## 0.5.4

### Minor Changes

- aeab467c: [input-stepper] a11y enhancement & added translations

### Patch Changes

- aeab467c: [checkbox-group] add role="list" and role="listitem" to checkbox-indeterminate and its children

- aeab467c: [form-core]: set aria-disabled next to the disabled attribute for NVDA screen reader
- aeab467c: [form-core] remove fieldset label/helpt-text from input-field aria-labelledby/aria-describedby. See https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/issues/1576
- aeab467c: [input-range] add screen-reader labels for minimum and maximum value
- aeab467c: feat: split validate-messages-no-side-effects methods, so they can be bundled along with entrypoints.

  For optimized bundling, it's reccommended to load feedback messages per entrypoint. For instance, when you only use form-core in your app:

  ```js
  import { LionInputTel } from '@lion/ui/input-tel.js';
  import { getLocalizeManager } from '@lion/ui/localize-no-side-effects.js';
  import { loadInputTelMessagesNoSideEffects } from '@lion/ui/validate-messages-no-side-effects.js';

  export class MyInputTel extends LionInputTel {
    constructor() {
      super();
      loadInputTelMessagesNoSideEffects({ localize: getLocalizeManager() });
    }
  }
  ```

  This prevents you from loading unused entrypoints like input-tel (which loads a full phone validation library) etc.

- 0d4c42ab: [listbox] allow use of arrow keys when focus is not on listbox

- 84173cdb: lion-select-rich: when the overlay is shown, the "autofocus" attribute is added to \_listboxNode (\_inputNode) to make sure that keyboard navigation continues to work when the element is inside a an element with `trapsKeyboardFocus:true`, like the bottomsheet created via `withBottomSheetConfig()`. When the overlay is closed the attribute is removed.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cee40e55: Side-effect-free alternative for `localize` (the globally shared instance of LocalizeManager).
  When this function is imported, no side-effect happened yet, i.e. no global instance was registered yet.
  The side effect-free approach generates:

  - smaller, optimized bundles
  - a predictable loading order, that allows for:
    - deduping strategies when multiple instances of the localizeManager are on a page
    - providing a customized extension of LocalizeManager

  Also see: https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/discussions/1861

  Use it like this:

  ```js
  function myFunction() {
    // note that 'localizeManager' is the same as former 'localize'
    const localizeManager = getLocalizeManger();
    // ...
  }
  ```

  In a class, we advise a shared instance:

  ```js
  class MyClass {
    constructor() {
      this._localizeManager = getLocalizeManger();
    }
    // ...
  }
  ```

  Make sure to always call this method inside a function or class (otherwise side effects are created)

  Do you want to register your own LocalizeManager?
  Make sure it's registered before anyone called `getLocalizeManager()`

  ```js
  import { singletonManager } from 'singleton-manager';
  import { getLocalizeManger } from '@lion/ui/localize-no-side-effects.js';

  // First register your own LocalizeManager (for deduping or other reasons)
  singletonManager.set('lion/ui::localize::0.x', class MyLocalizeManager extends LocalizeManager {});

  // Now, all your code gets the right instance
  export function myFn() {
    const localizeManager = getLocalizeManager();
    // ...
  }

  export class myClass() {
    constructor() {
      this._localizeManager = getLocalizeManager();
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```

- 0efce8e1: [localize] parse negative numbers

## 0.0.12

### Patch Changes

- 7ac0a422: [overlays] fixes (responsive backdrop/select-rich/tooltip)

## 0.0.11

### Patch Changes

- 5e707168: [tooltip] prevent infinite loops
- 49092c97: `accordion`: narrowed the scope of the selectors that query [slot=invoker] and [slot=content] to prevent that any nested elements with [slot=invoker] and [slot=content] are moved to slot=\_accordion as well
- fafd9222: overlays: add adopted stylesheets once; attach correctly to body

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 36910e5d: datepicker uses no calender-overlay-frame element anymore
- 64c0e26c: Overlay System uses `<dialog>` for top layer functionality of all overlays.
  This means overlays positioned relative to viewport won't be moved to the body.

  This has many benefits for the App Developer:

  - "context" will be kept:
    - css variables and parts/theme will work
    - events work without the need for "repropagation" (from body to original context)
    - accessibility relations between overlay content and its context do not get lost
  - initial renderings become more predictable (since we don't need multiple initializations on multiple connectedCallbacks)
  - performance: less initialization, thus better performance
  - maintainability: handling all edge cases involved in moving an overlay to the body grew out of hand
  - developer experience:
    - no extra container components like overlay-frame/calendar-frame needed that maintain styles
    - adding a contentWrapperNode is not needed anymore

  There could be small differences in timings though (usually we're done rendering quicker now).
  Code that relies on side effects could be affected. Like:

  - the existence of a global Root node)
  - the fact that global styles would reach a dialog placed in the body

  For most users using either OverlayController, OverlayMixin or an element that uses OverlayMixin (like LionInputDatepicker, LionRichSelect etc. etc.)
  nothing will change in the public api.

  import { LocalizeManager } from '@lion/ui/localize-no-side-effects.js';

  class MyLocalizeManager extends LocalizeManager {}

  singletonManager.set('@lion/ui::localize::0.x', new MyLocalizeManager());

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- e08b6bec: This introduces a new package `@lion/ui` which is a collection of UI components that can be used in your application. It contains all the components/systems that used to be distributed via separate `@lion/*` packages.

  This is a breaking as you will need to import all components from `@lion/ui` instead of `@lion/*` packages now.

  ```diff
  - import { LionAccordion } from '@lion/accordion';
  + import { LionAccordion } from '@lion/ui/accordion.js';
  ```

  This is also true for element registrations

  ```diff
  - import '@lion/accordion/define';
  + import '@lion/ui/define/lion-accordion.js';
  ```

  Essentially the whole public API e.g. all the available exports can be found in the [exports](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/tree/master/packages/ui/exports) folder.

  The package only supports TS 4.7+ using `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` or `"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"` as described in the [TS 4.7 Announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7/#package-json-exports-imports-and-self-referencing).

  This package will have a new single CHANGELOG.md for the whole package. If you are interested the older individual changelogs then you can find them in the [\_legacy-changelogs folder](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/tree/master/packages/ui/_legacy-changelogs).

  This new version also includes the following changes for it's containing components:

  - fix(switch): SwitchButton do not dispatch checked-change event when is disabled
  - fix(calendar): calendar translation de.js strings corrected

  Note: This package is considered alpha until extending docs and type exports are verified.

- Updated dependencies [e08b6bec]
  - singleton-manager@1.6.0
