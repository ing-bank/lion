# Change Log

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d178a5: add interceptors for parsed response JSON objects

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- c5ffe9cf: Allow getCacheIdentifier to be asynchronous
- df8bf58f: Reset cache and pending requests when cache session ID changes
- a8105ec2: Add caching tests for when getCacheIdentifier is asynchronous

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- b9b8ab9d: add documentation for xsrfTrustedOrigins

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 04d08683: BREAKING: Only add XSRF token on mutable requests and on same origin or whitelisted origins

  Previously the XSRF token was added to any call to any origin.
  This is changed in two ways.
  (1) The token is now only attached to requests that are POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.
  (2) It will validate if the request origin is the same as current origin or when the origin is in the xsrfTrustedOrigins.

  This is a fix for a vulnerability: we inadvertently revealed the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host. This allowed attackers to view sensitive information.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0952647d: make return type for `fetchJson` generic

## 1.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 55e445c2: fix: export ajax types

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 275f49eb: Preserve error name and enrich it with the response status

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 9cdac8e9: Clone response before reading and parsing the body.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a875ef1: Parses response body automatically for fetchJson failed responses. Add test for reading out the response body in cases of a failed response in regular fetch call.

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- fd93cc0c: fix: avoid JSON.parsing empty responses

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 63bb012e: fetchJSON will try to parse Response body as JSON if the content-type headers are missing, in this case it will assume JSON.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 2553e7ac: fix: relax content type restriction of json response

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- bfd5152a: fix: relax content types when setting cache

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e08b6bec: Update to use `package exports` with a dedicated `types` entry.
  This means the package only supports node 16+ and TS 4.7+ with `moduleResolution: Node16` or `moduleResolution: NodeNext` as described in the [TS 4.7 Announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7/#package-json-exports-imports-and-self-referencing).

### Patch Changes

- 66abd3ea: don't throw on non-JSON responses in fetchJson

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 18287a64: First major release (no difference with 0.16.0)

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- e7a4ca1d: Add "type":"module" to ESM packages so loaders like Vite will interpret the package as ESM properly.
- 447383bd: Add a `maxCacheSize` cache option to specify a max size for the whole cache

### Patch Changes

- 362ee0e2: Align intercepted and non-intercepted response behavior

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 558edcb6: Adds a `maxResponseSize` cache option to specify a max size for responses to be cached. The option prevents caching and cache retrieval for responses that are larger than the given maximum as reported in the `Content-Length` header. If this header is missing nothing happens, that is to say caching is not prevented.
- efcdf653: Adds a `contentTypes` cache option to specify a whitelist of content types to be cached. The option prevents caching and cache retrieval for responses that do not have one of these values in the `Content-Type` header.
- 56af96f1: Add an option "addCaching" to the Ajax config, in order to add cache interceptors when useCache is turned off. In this situation, all requests are cached proactively.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- aa8b8916: BREAKING CHANGE: Work without polyfill if possible

  When using [component composition](https://lit.dev/docs/composition/component-composition/) in a Lion Component we always made it very explicit which sub-components are used.
  On top of that we scoped these [sub components](https://open-wc.org/docs/development/scoped-elements/) to the [current shadow root](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Scoped-Custom-Element-Registries.md) allowing multiple version to be used simultaneously.

  To enable this features we relied on the fact that the `ScopedElementsMixin` did loaded the needed polyfill for us.

  We however over time got feedback from multiple consumers that lion components "break the app as soon as you load them".
  The reasons is/was that not everyone is always using `ScopedElementsMixin` or in full control of the app (or its load order).

  To quote the release notes of `ScopedElementsMixin` v2.1.0:

  > ScopedElementsMixin 2.x tried to be as convenient as possible by automatically loading the scoped custom elements registry polyfill.
  > This however led to a fatal error whenever you registered any component before ScopedElementsMixin was used.

  And this was the case.

  With the upgrade to `@open-wc/scoped-elements` v2.1.1 Lion now no longer automatically loads the polyfill through `ScopedElementsMixin`.

  This essentially means the polyfill became optional which results in the following behavior

  1. If polyfill is not loaded it will use the global registry as a fallback
  2. Log error if actually scoping is needed and polyfill is not loaded
  3. If you manually create elements you will need to handle polyfilled and not polyfilled cases now

  ```diff
  -  const myButton = this.shadowRoot.createElement('my-button');
  +  const myButton = this.createScopedElement('my-button');
  ```

  This also removes `@webcomponents/scoped-custom-element-registry` as a production dependency.

  If you need scoping be sure to load the polyfill before any other web component gets registered.

  It may look something like this in your HTML

  ```html
  <script src="/node_modules/@webcomponents/scoped-custom-element-registry/scoped-custom-element-registry.min.js"></script>
  ```

  or if you have an SPA you can load it at the top of your app shell code

  ```js
  import '@webcomponents/scoped-custom-element-registry';
  ```

  You need scoping if you want to

  use 2 major versions of a web component (e.g. in an SPA pageA uses 1.x and pageB uses 2.x of color-picker)
  or you want to use the same tag name with different implementations (use tag color-picker from foo here and from bar here)

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 683d5c1c: Upgrade to latest Typescript. Keep in mind, some @ts-ignores were necessary, also per TS maintainer's advice. Use skipLibCheck in your TSConfig to ignore issues coming from Lion, the types are valid.

  **We also unfixed lion's dependencies (now using caret ^) on its own packages**, because it caused a lot of problems with duplicate installations for end users as well as subclassers and its end users. Both of these changes may affect subclassers in a breaking manner, hence the minor bump.

  Be sure to [read our Rationale on this change](https://lion-web.netlify.app/docs/rationales/versioning/) and what this means for you as a user.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 43e4bb81: Type fixes and enhancements:

  - all protected/private entries added to form-core type definitions, and their dependents were fixed
  - a lot @ts-expect-error and @ts-ignore (all `get slots()` and `get modelValue()` issues are fixed)
  - categorized @ts-expect-error / @ts-ignore into:
    - [external]: when a 3rd party didn't ship types (could also be browser specs)
    - [allow-protected]: when we are allowed to know about protected methods. For instance when code
      resides in the same package
    - [allow-private]: when we need to check a private value inside a test
    - [allow]: miscellaneous allows
    - [editor]: when the editor complains, but the cli/ci doesn't

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 4452d06d: BREAKING CHANGE: We no longer use axios! Our ajax package is now a thin wrapper around Fetch. The API has changed completely. You will need a fetch polyfill for IE11.
- b2f981db: Add exports field in package.json

  Note that some tools can break with this change as long as they respect the exports field. If that is the case, check that you always access the elements included in the exports field, with the same name which they are exported. Any item not exported is considered private to the package and should not be accessed from the outside.

- bbffd710: Added Ajax cache interceptors.
